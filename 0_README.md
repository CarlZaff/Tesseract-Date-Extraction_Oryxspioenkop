# Tesseract-Date-Extraction_Oryxspioenkop
Methodology to extract dates or other short strings of text from images containing a variety of unwanted clutter.

Method instructions will be included in '0_Method Instructions.pdf'

All code included in the repository is written by me. Almost all code is commented to easier understand what the process does.
However, due to limited knowledge and expertice in programming, parts of the process and code is clumsy and can be further improved.
